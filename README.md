Pharmacy operations frequently experience differences between medication quantities billed and those ordered, which results in financial losses and increased manual processing. 
In this case study, a desktop-based analytics application was developed to automate medication billing and order quantity reconciliation. 
The application processes billing and order datasets, computes aggregated quantities and detects shortages and overages. It offers a user interface to present results. 
The application is optimized to run locally to support data privacy. It was tested using large-scale synthetic datasets exceeding 700 medications. 
The results show significant improvements in processing efficiency and usability.
